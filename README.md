# Python Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my Python solutions to selected exercises from the
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) platform.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate strong Python fundamentals,
clean code practices, and attention to edge cases. All solutions are written
with readability and proper documentation in mind.

## What this demonstrates
- Clean and readable Python code
- Clear function design with meaningful naming
- Input validation and defensive programming
- Handling of edge cases
- Writing framework-independent business logic

## Structure
Each exercise is placed in its own directory and contains a fully documented
solution file.
